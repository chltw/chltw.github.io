My name is Ching-Hua Lee and I study a number of subjects in machine learning and signal processing.

- I am a Senior Machine Learning Researcher at [Samsung Research America](https://sra.samsung.com/).
- I completed my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [UC San Diego](https://www.ece.ucsd.edu/) in 2020 under the supervision of [Prof. Bhaskar D. Rao](https://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/node/3416), an Ericsson Endowed Chair and Distinguished Professor, and [Dr. Harinath Garudadri](https://qi.ucsd.edu/about/leadership/harinath-garudadri/).
- I received my B.S. degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering at [National Taiwan University](https://web.ee.ntu.edu.tw/eng/) in 2013.

My research focuses on efficient machine learning and signal processing solutions for speech and audio applications, including Single/Multi-Channel Speech Enhancement, Keyword Spotting, Speech Recognition/Translation and Speech-LLMs. During my Ph.D. in UC San Diego, I worked on adaptive filtering research with applications to speech processing in hearing aids.
